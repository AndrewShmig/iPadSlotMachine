APPLICATION DETAILS

iPadSlotMachine is a multi-iPad slot machine simulator. When the app starts,
its user is presented with a choice: to create a new machine or to join an
existing one.

If "Create New" is selected, the app becomes the master controller for the slot machine.
Instances running on other local iPads may then join the machine. When they do,
they are assigned roles. Possible roles include:

  Reels. These are the wheels of the slot machine. Initially up to 3 reels will be supported.

  Handle. This device will be swung by its user to start the slot machine. It is likely 
  that this device will be an iPhone.

  Hopper. This iPad will report the results. In the case of winning spins, it will show 
  coins or some similar animated reward.

The master controller will have any necessary controls to manage connections, a reset
button to reset the machine, and test controls to start the machine if the handle is
unavailable.

The slot machine will support multiple modes of operation. One mode will display
classical slot machine graphics. Another mode will display digits from 0-9 on each
reel in a way that allows it to be used to select tickets for raffles. Other modes
may also be added.

A pull of the handle will send a message to the master, which will in turn launch the reels. 
Each wheel will spin independently and stop at a random time. We may optionally add "Stop"
buttons to each reel to allow each reel to be stopped separately. When all wheels have
stopped, a score or other summary result will be calculated and displayed on the hopper.

Appropriate sounds would be awesome. Audio feedback through the iPad microphone would be
nice for randomizing or otherwise driving the reels.
